# BNO080 lib for ESP-IDF

original code : https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BNO080_Arduino_Library

Contains adaptation classes for `SerialPrint` and i2c functions. Functions like `pinmode` or `delay` where replaced by null-functions.

## Modification based on the original library

in the `SparkFun_BNO80_Arduino_Library.h` file I added some includes and typedefs. Those should be the only lines that i touched in the original library source code.

## Disclaimer

The example main.cpp is the only thing that I tested :) All the other library features haven't been tested.
